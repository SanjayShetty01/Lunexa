      <p class="subtitle">Arbitrage & Hedge Calculator</p>

      <p>
        Lunexa is a precision-focused betting calculator designed to help you
        identify and manage <span class="accent">risk-free opportunities</span>
        using real market odds. Whether you are analysing odds before placing a
        bet or locking in profit after odds move, Lunexa gives you clear,
        math-driven answers.
      </p>

      <h2>Pre-Bet Arbitrage</h2>
      <p>
        Before placing any bets, Lunexa checks whether the available odds across
        different outcomes create an arbitrage opportunity. When one exists,
        it calculates the exact stake distribution needed to guarantee profit,
        regardless of the outcome.
      </p>

      <h2>Post-Bet Hedging</h2>
      <p>
        If you have already placed a bet and the odds change later, Lunexa helps
        you determine whether you can hedge to break even or secure a guaranteed
        profit. You can set your goal; break-even, percentage profit, or a
        minimum profit amount; and Lunexa will calculate the required hedge.
      </p>
